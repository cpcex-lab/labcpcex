## Introduction

The Experimental and Computational Political Science Lab (`lab_cpcex`) develops political science research and applied projects with intense experimental, computer science, and statistical methods. The `lab_cpcex` has three main objectives:

1. Answer political science research questions that causal and prediction methods can tackle.
2. Apply computational approaches to environmental, and human development projects, and public policy analysis.
3. Produce and disseminate courses and teaching materials related to the field.
